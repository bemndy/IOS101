Submitted by: Brandon Martinez

Fun background is an app that has three labels about me, and changes 
the color of the background randomly with a button.

Time spent: 0.5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## Video Walkthrough

Here is a reminder on how to embed Loom videos on GitHub. Feel free to remove this reminder once you upload your README.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Instagram:
	Ui/Ux design is really beautiful and being able to access the camera
	to upload pictures/videos/stories is a great main feature

	Adding a heart button to keep track of heart per "item" which in this
	case would be each post.
Goat: 
	Having a clean general "feed" where images are displayed, each image
	when clicked has its own mini-screen to show details of the shoe
	and the market/price set by buyers
	
	Dark mode
Spotify: 
	Able to download music on the fly whenever you are in an area that
	does not have any service, you always have the backups you downloaded
	on spotify. 
	
	Being able to play music while going through with other apps and seeing the
	elegant UI features that are displayed amongst the home-screen, lock-screen,
	widgets. 

	Having interactive features like the lyric-generator and stories on spotify. 
Youtube:
	Being able to have the little square that pops up so you can watch mini-screened
	videos while also navigating the rest of your phone. 
	
	Being able to send videos to other people on imessage and have it synced up.

I want to create an App that works with object-detection. Potentially training a model of some sort
that would initially get a bunch of photos a person and their hair specifically. Each day you rate how 
nice you like your hair (potentially with a simple 'like' or heart, or with a numeric score). As the 
amount of pictures you take accumulates (with a preset model of hair simmilar to yours) as the days go by
you can wake up every morning, and before you leave somewhere have the app show a picture of your face
and decide whether you have a good enough hairday or not. This could expand to an app that would also show you
different types of hairstyles, show maybe improvements on skin-health for people on treatement plans, potentially
work with other apps like health to track your sleep and show correlations. Not something super useful but would implement a lot of features that would give good experience with App building. 
 
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Getting used to the XCode enviorement, the workplace is really fully-featured, I am excited.
